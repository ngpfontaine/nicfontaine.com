      <h3>Zoom Scheduling App</h3>

      <p>
        A small session scheduling web-app created to connect a group of learners, over a few-week timespan, to multiple Zoom accounts for simulation delivery. Built on NodeJS with Express to manage views, and using the ZOOM RestAPI to create and cancel meetings. Without the need for a full database, sign-up contact info &amp; zoom url are entered into a JSON file organized by date.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <div class="cont-img-inl">
          <img src="./img/code/web-session-scheduling-01.png" alt="scheduling application">  
        </div>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Nodemailer is used to send booking confirmation emails, and are set to send a reminder before the scheduled session time. Booking emails contain cancellation links that clear the Zoom meeting entry, reminder-email flag, and booking slot.
      </p>

        I won't try to paraphrase Ian's (a chaired law professor at Berkeley) ideas and insights as I feel that is better left to him, but for the technical info - I designed a custom, simple, and clean Wordpress theme built for regular additions of writings, interviews, and events &amp; publications.

      <p>
        I feel the site does a good job of cleanly hosting his work in a unique and memorable fashion while neither falling short and coming off as a basic blog theme or pushing too much design for the collegiate/political world.

    <!-- Start Page -->
    <section>

      <h3>Start Page</h3>

      <p>
        I wanted a personalized start page with common links I use, search features, and relevant hud stats and naturally it had to be navigable w/o the use of a mouse. Additionally, I wanted local info like weather, time, and IP auto-configured; and important information legible from across the room w/o taking over the smaller elements in the viewport.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <div class="cont-img-inl">
          <img src="./img/code/web_start_page_01.png" alt="personal in-browser start page">  
        </div>
      </figure>

      <p>
        You can use 'ctrl + c' to randomly change the colour palette, and use arrow keys to navigate any of the search and link functions of the page while still being completely touch/pointer friendly. The tile grid of links is calculated by vertical offset, and re-logs on browser resize so it should handle any number of additional or subtracted link tiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Background weather images are loaded in response from local weather data polled every 20s, and crossfade when weather conditions change. Mini search icons are listed below the search input to correspond with search sites; and switch when clicked, L or R arrow keys are used, or the search field is swiped on mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've included arrays to easily add more search sites, respective placeholder names for them, and corresponding icons. I regularly add new features, and you're welcome to check out and/or fork on github. I'm glad to help out if you're not completely familiar with js/html/css and want to personalize your own.

    <section>

      <h3>GFV - JQuery Form Validation</h3>

      <p>
        Unhappy with form validation on our landing pages at Element-360 I created an extension with JQuery, exclusively to extend the capabilities of Gravity Forms. In watching behaviour analysis recordings I found a large number of people clicking the CTA to immediately receive information. This results in a page reload with error messages appended to the required fields - not an optimal user experience.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <div class="cont-img-inl">
          <img class="fl-l img-inl" src="./img/code/web_form_validation_gif_02.gif" alt="gravity forms standard page refresh validation"><img class="fl-r img-inl" src="./img/code/web_form_validation_gif_01.gif" alt="My custom on page validation for gravity forms">
        </div>
      </figure>

      <p>
        My goals were:
        <ul>
          <li>Live validation/disable button send until form fulfilled</li>
          <li>UI change from button click - of blank required fields</li>
          <li>Validation check (logic and visual) on field blur</li>
          <li>Email regex validation</li>
          <li>Client-side validation, w/o AJAX</li>
          <li>Simple, safisfying UX (people have a mote of tolerance on landing pages)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally I implemented a button text update on send - as on slower networks, lag is generally perceived as a site bug and users will spam-click out of frustration. An easy way to prevent form submissions, while adding a useful onclick event, was to place a 'cover' button over the gravity forms send button. Clicks on the cover check required fields and add classes to notify the user. Field blur, focus, and change events check input validation and form completion, while adding and removing visual classes.

        I used the unfortunate opportunity to learn explore some more PHP in creating a site to easily upload images into a hosted gallery. Images auto-resize and compress using the Tinify API. Images are pulled at a max number, with pagination and arrow navigation between pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's filled with small touches, but the paw print pagin &amp; "overpull" style navigation to next page on mobile is my favourite.

        Whew, look at that compression nightmare of a collage.. I've made hundreds of ads for many diverse ad campaigns for the GDN as well as Zillow. Headlines and CTA's are chosen from text ad PPC performance in Adwords, and coupled with unique branding styles from each individual client.

      <p>
        Claudette has strong opinions on what she does and does not like, and luckily for me her ideas are always fun and unconvential. Her reaction when I asked if she wanted a 'hamburger' menu was a priceless progression of confusion > research > disguist.
      </p>

      <p>
        She also loved my idea for an "anti-slideshow" atop the homepage. It's great to have a client who can appreciate and complain with the best of 'em, and it's easy to foster great design inspiration when awesome content is brought to the table.

        I created this portfolio website as a collective showcase of the work of two colleagues and myself for various freelance design and development projects we had taken on. I hadn't been working on much web design at the time so it was fun to develop with no restrictions and have an excuse to try and learn some new things along the way.
